Examples of some services that offer city searching:\r\n    - https://airhex.com/api/cities/\r\n    - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/autocomplete\r\n    - https://apidocs.geoapify.com/playground/geocoding/#autocomplete\r\n    - Note that most of the above services require you to obtain an API key\r\n   \r\n\r\nNote that you can also try using existing libraries, like https://github.com/tomickigrzegorz/autocomplete, https://github.com/TarekRaafat/autoComplete.js or even https://slimselectjs.com/ for this, but try to understand how they work.\r\n\r\n",
